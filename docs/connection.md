Interfacing with CEGA â‡Œ SDA
===========================

All Local EGA instances are connected to Central EGA using
[RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com), a Message Broker, that allows the
components to send and receive messages, which are queued, not lost, and
resent on network failure or connection problems.

The RabbitMQ message brokers of each SDA instance are the **only**
components with the necessary credentials to connect to Central EGA
message broker.

We call `CEGAMQ` and `LocalMQ` (Local Message Broker, also known as
`sda-mq`), the RabbitMQ message brokers of, respectively, `Central EGA`
and `SDA`/`LocalEGA`.

Local Message Broker
--------------------

> NOTE:
> Source code repository for MQ component is available at:
> [https://github.com/neicnordic/sda-mq](https://github.com/neicnordic/sda-mq)


### Configuration

The following environment variables can be used to configure the broker:

> NOTE:
> We use [RabbitMQ](https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq) >= `3.8.16` including
> the management plugins.

Variable             | Description
:--------------------|:----------------------------------------------
`MQ_VHOST`           | Default vhost other than `/`
`MQ_VERIFY`          | Set to `verify_none` to disable verification of client certificate
`MQ_USER`            | Default user (with admin rights)
`MQ_PASSWORD_HASH`   | Password hash for the above user
`CEGA_CONNECTION`    | DSN URL for the shovels and federated queues with CentralEGA
`MQ_SERVER_CERT`     | Path to the server SSL certificate                                                                          
`MQ_SERVER_KEY`      | Path to the server SSL key                                                                                    
`MQ_CA`              | Path to the CA root certificate
`MQ_VERIFY`          | Require the clients to have valid TLS certificates (`verify_peer`) or do not require clients to have certificates (`verify_none`)
`NOTLS`              | Run the server without TLS enabled (default is to run the server with TLS activated)

> NOTE:
> For SDA stand-alone do not use `CEGA_CONNECTION` and do not set up
> `Intercept` service. This will cause no messages to be shoveled to a
> CentralEGA, whilst the queues stay the same. `Orchestrator` service
> would need to be set up to send and recive messages between other
> services.

Central EGA connection
----------------------

`CEGAMQ` declares a `vhost` for each SDA instance. It also creates the
credentials to connect to that `vhost` in the form of a
*username/password* pair. The connection uses the AMQP(S) protocol.

`LocalMQ` then uses a connection string with the following syntax:

```
amqp[s]://<user>:<password>@<cega-host>:<port>/<vhost>
```

> NOTE:
> All the messages received from CEGA are intercepted by `Intercept`
> service and forwarded to the right queue in the `LocalMQ`

`CEGAMQ` contains an exchange named `localega.v1`. `v1` is used for
versioning and is internal to CentralEGA. The queues connected to that
exchange are also internal to CentralEGA.

Name             | Purpose
:----------------|:------------------------------------------------
files            | Triggers for file ingestion
completed        | When files are backed up
verified         | When files are properly ingested and verified
errors           | User-related errors
inbox            | Notifications of uploaded files

`LocalMQ` contains two exchanges named `sda` and `to_cega`, and the
following queues, in the default `vhost`:

Name             | Purpose
:----------------|:---------------------------------------
archived         | Archived files.
backup           | Signal files to backup
completed        | Files are backed up
error            | User-related errors
files            | Receive notification for ingestion from `CEGAMQ` or Orchestrator
inbox            | Notifications of uploaded files
ingest           | Trigger for file ingestion
mappings         | Received Dataset to file mapping
accessionIDs     | Receive Accession IDs from `CEGAMQ` or Orchestrator
verified         | Files ingested and verified

`LocalMQ` registers `CEGAMQ` as an *upstream* and listens to the
incoming messages in `files` using a *federated queue*. Ingestion
workers listen to the `files` queue of the local broker. If there are no
messages to work on, `LocalMQ` will ask its upstream queue if it has
messages. If so, messages are moved downstream. If not the Ingest
Service will wait for messages to arrive.

> NOTE:
> More information can be found also at
> [localEGA](https://localega.readthedocs.io/en/latest/amqp.html#message-interface-api-cega-connect-lega).

`CEGAMQ` receives notifications from `LocalMQ` using a *shovel*.
Everything that is published to its `to_cega` exchange gets forwarded to
CentralEGA (using the routing key based on the name
`files.<internal_queue_name>`). We propagate the different status of the
workflow to CentralEGA, using the following routing keys:

Name                 | Purpose
---------------------|:-------------------------------------------------
files.completed      | For back-up files, ready to be distributed
files.error          | In case a user-related error is detected
files.inbox          | For inbox file operations
files.verified       | For files ready to request accessionID

Note that we do not need at the moment a queue to store the completed
message, nor the errors, as we forward them to Central EGA.

Connecting SDA to Central EGA
-----------------------------

Central EGA only has to prepare a user/password pair along with a
`vhost` in their RabbitMQ.

When Central EGA has communicated these details to the given Local EGA
instance, the latter can contact Central EGA using the federated queue
and the shovel mechanism in their local broker.

CentralEGA should then see 2 incoming connections from that new LocalEGA
instance, on the given `vhost`.

The exchanges and routing keys will be the same as all the other
LocalEGA instances, since the clustering is done per `vhost`.

### Message Format

It is necessary to agree on the format of the messages exchanged between
Central EGA and any Local EGAs. Central EGA's messages are
JSON-formatted.

The JSON schemas can be found in:
<https://github.com/neicnordic/sda-pipeline/tree/master/schemas>

When a `Submission Inbox` sends an `upload` message to CentralEGA it contains the
following:

```javascript
{
   "operation": "upload",
   "user":"john.smith@smth.org",
   "filepath":"somedir/encrypted.file.c4gh",
   "file_last_modified": 1668071942,
   "encrypted_checksums": [
      { "type": "md5", "value": "1a79a4d60de6718e8e5b326e338ae533"},
      { "type": "sha256", "value": "50d858e0985ecc7f60418aaf0cc5ab587f42c2570a884095a9e8ccacd0f6545c"}
   ]
}
```

In order to identify the type of inbox activity, `operation` in the
above message can have the following values:

-   `upload` - when a file is uploaded;
-   `remove` - when a file is deleted;
-   `rename` - when a file is renamed.

Remove message:

```javascript
{
   "operation": "remove",
   "user":"john.smith@smth.org",
   "filepath":"somedir/encrypted.file.c4gh",
}
```

Rename message:

```javascript
{
   "operation": "rename",
   "user":"john.smith@smth.org",
   "filepath":"somedir/encrypted-new.file.c4gh",
   "oldpath": "somedir/encrypted.file.c4gh",
}
```

CentralEGA triggers the ingestion and the message sent to `files` queue
contains the same information. In order to distinguish messages, Central
EGA adds a field named type to all outgoing messages. There are 5 types
of messages:

-   `type=ingest`: an ingestion trigger
-   `type=cancel`: an ingestion cancellation
-   `type=accession`: contains an accession id
-   `type=mapping`: contains a dataset to accession ids mapping
-   `type=heartbeat`: A mean to check if the Local EGA instance is
    "alive"

> IMPORTANT:
> The `encrypted_checksums` key is optional. If the key is not present the
> sha256 checksum will be calculated by `Ingest` service.

The message received from Central EGA to start ingestion at a Federated EGA node.
Processed by the the sda-pipeline `ingest` service.

```javascript
{
   "type": "ingest",
   "user":"john.smith@smth.org",
   "filepath":"somedir/encrypted.file.c4gh",
   "encrypted_checksums": [
      { "type": "md5", "value": "1a79a4d60de6718e8e5b326e338ae533"},
      { "type": "sha256", "value": "50d858e0985ecc7f60418aaf0cc5ab587f42c2570a884095a9e8ccacd0f6545c"}
   ]
}
```

The `Ingest` service upon successful operation will send a message to
`archived` queue containing:

```javascript
{
   "file_id": 1,
   "archive_path": "somedir/encrypted.file.c4gh",
   "user":"john.smith@smth.org",
   "filepath":"somedir/encrypted.file.c4gh",
   "encrypted_checksums": [
      { "type": "md5", "value": "1a79a4d60de6718e8e5b326e338ae533"},
      { "type": "sha256", "value": "50d858e0985ecc7f60418aaf0cc5ab587f42c2570a884095a9e8ccacd0f6545c"}
   ],
   "re_verify": false
}
```

`Verify` service will consume set message and will forward to `verified`
queue and *shoveled* to `CEGAMQ` but also adding a key
`decrypted_checksums`, which will respond with the same content, but
adding the [Accession ID]{.title-ref}.

```javascript
{
   "user":"john",
   "filepath":"somedir/encrypted.file.c4gh",
   "decrypted_checksums": [
      { "type": "md5", "value": "50d858e0985ecc7f60418aaf0cc5ab587f42c2570a884095a9e8ccacd0f6545c"},
      { "type": "sha256", "value": "1a79a4d60de6718e8e5b326e338ae533"}
   ]
}
```

`Finalize` service should receive the message below and assign the
`Accession ID` to the corresponding file and send a message to `backup`
queue for the backup services or in case there is no backup service to
the `completed` queue.

```javascript
{
    "type": "accession",
    "user": "john.smith@smth.org",
    "filepath": "somedir/encrypted.file.c4gh",
    "accession_id": "EGAF00000123456",
    "decrypted_checksums": [ 
        { "type": "sha256", "value": "50d858e0985ecc7f60418aaf0cc5ab587f42c2570a884095a9e8ccacd0f6545c" },
        { "type": "md5", "value": "1a79a4d60de6718e8e5b326e338ae533" }
    ]
}
```

The message sent from the sda-pipeline `finalize` service to the `backup` service via `completed` queue.

```javascript
{
    "user": "john.smith@smth.org",
    "filepath": "somedir/encrypted.file.c4gh",
    "accession_id": "EGAF00000123456",
    "decrypted_checksums": [ 
        { "type": "sha256", "value": "50d858e0985ecc7f60418aaf0cc5ab587f42c2570a884095a9e8ccacd0f6545c" },
        { "type": "md5", "value": "1a79a4d60de6718e8e5b326e338ae533" }
    ]
}
```

`Mapper` service after the file has been published should receive a
message containing accession IDs mapping between files and datasets

```javascript
{
   "type": "mapping",
   "user":"john.smith@smth.org",
   "dataset_id": "EGAD12345678901",
   "accession_ids": ["EGAF00000123456", "EGAF00000123457"]
}
```
