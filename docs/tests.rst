Testing
-------

We have implemented 2 types of testsuite: 

- one set of *unit tests* to test the functionalities of the code; 
- one set of *integration tests* to test the overall architecture.

The latter does actually deploy a chosen setup and runs several scenarios, users
will utilize the system as a whole, .

.. note:: Unit tests and integration tests are automatically executed 
          with every push and PR to the ``NBIS Github repo``.
