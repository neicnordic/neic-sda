The Sensitive Data Archive (SDA) was developed as an extension of the
[European phenome-Genome Archive (EGA)](https://ega-archive.org/),
for federating storage of sensitive data.
Federating storage has several benefits,
especially for data that has legal requirements to stay in a certain country.

Setting up the system to receive remote messages on how to behave will be called _federated_.
Setting up the system with an internal message service will be called _standalone_.
